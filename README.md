   ```

2. **Register the Service Provider (if using Laravel < 5.5):**

   Add the following line to your `config/app.php` file in the `providers` array:

   ```php
   Tsrgtm\DbManager\DbManagerServiceProvider::class,
   ```

## Usage

### Step 1: Add the Livewire Component

You can use the Livewire component in your Blade views. Hereâ€™s an example of how to include the DB Manager component in your Blade file:

```blade
@extends('layouts.app')

@section('content')
    <div class="container">
        @livewire('db-manager')
    </div>
@endsection
```

### Step 2: Accessing the DB Manager

After including the Livewire component, you can access the DB Manager through your application. It will display all database tables and allow you to perform CRUD operations.

## CRUD Operations
